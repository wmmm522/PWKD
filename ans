7. Indicate the difference between eutectoid and proeutectoid ferrite 
The proeutectoid ferrite forms in alloys with composition on the left of the eutectoid one when the temperature is higher the eutectoid one. It consists in grains of alpha-ferrite in the gamma-austenite phase 
The eutectoid ferrite is the one that forms under the eutectoid temperature together with the cementite layers


8. Describe how different cooling rates can modify the final properties of a material. 
If we consider iron-carbon alloys with eutectoid composition, the cooling rate changes the phase distribution in the crystals variating the mechanical properties of the material, such as hardness and ductility. For these materials a slow cooling ends up in coarse or fine pearlite a medium one in bainite and a fast one in martensite that respectively shows an increasing of hardness and a decreasing of the ductility for the previous. 
For the Iron-Carbon alloys, starting from austenite what phases can be obtained by varying the cooling rate? Describe the differences in mechanical properties 
From austenite with corresponding cooling rate from low to high we can get: 
- spheroidite: 2 phases (small ferrite particles) 
- coarse perlite: 2 phases 
- fine perlite: 2 phases 
- bainite: 2 phases 
- martensite: 1 phase (BCT structure of Iron atoms with supersaturated interstitial C atoms) 

The mechanical properties see an increasing of hardness and brittleness with the increasing of the cooling rate


9. Describe the defects present in the bi-dimensional crystalline structure. Associate to one or more defects present in the crystal one or more examples of their influence on the final properties of the material 
Interstitial impurity atoms: formation of an alloy to improve the properties 
Substitutional impurity atom: doping (for semiconductors this improves the conductivity) or alloying 
Vacancies: Thanks to the vacancies in ionic solids, at high temperature they become electricity conductors because the atoms are free to move (Schotty defects)



10. Carbon fibers: ribbons of graphite (Carbon based), strong, stiff and light weight but very brittle 
Describe the steps of the production process of carbon fibers from PAN 
Oxidation process to stabilize and stretch the fibers (300-400 °C) 
Carbonization process to remove all the non-carbon impurities such as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen (600-800 °C) 
Graphicization process that sees high temperature and stretching to set a preferential crystallization orientation (1500 - 3000 °C) 
Surface treatment for a better compatibility with epoxies


12. 
Silica glasses The basic structure is the tetrahedral ion SiO4 (4-) and the whole molecular structure is a SiO2 where every silicon atom is connected to 4 oxygen atoms and every oxygen atom is connected to 2 silicon atoms, ending up with the 1:2 ratio of Si/O. In the glassy state the structure is disordered, and they are hard and brittle but also highly thermally stable and very good at thermal shocks resistance and the glass transition temperature can be affected by the introduction of extra oxides such as Na2O, but these oxides do not form polyhedral networks with the silica.
