3. A copolymer is characterized by two different repeating units that can be arranged in different ways along the macromolecular chain: random, block, alternating, graft. Random copolymers can crystallize according to the composition, so if there's a prevalence of one of the repeating units the crystal phase will follow the one of those components. Block copolymers can crystallize only if the blocks are long enough to allow the chain fold. Alternating and graft copolymer can't crystallize.
